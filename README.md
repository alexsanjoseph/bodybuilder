# bodybuilder
An (almost!) drop in replacement of the Amazing Bodybuilder Package on NPM

# Variations
- `from` -> `from_` because `from` is a python keyword
- individual Filter/Query/Aggregations classes not implemented (shouldnt'f affect user)
- lambda functions instead of anonymous functions (Duh!)

# Not Implemented
- Complicated multi sort
